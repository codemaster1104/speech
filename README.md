with this program you can open any webpage by speech
to run the code(main.py):
1)install SpeechRecognition library

3)in the path variable put the path of chrome or desired web browser and change all "\" in path with "/" and add " %s" in the end of path

4)Now say the name of desired website for eg "amazon.com"
